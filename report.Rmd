For my homework, I'm selecting Tesla, Inc. as my last name starts with T.
As of this writing, Tesla's stock price is $`r stock_price`. I have downloaded
options prices from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/options)
on `r time_of_data`.

## Q1. Confirm that higher exercise prices mean lower call prices and higher put prices.

```{r}

```
